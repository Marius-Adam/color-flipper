## Description

1/10 project from Learn Vanilla JavaScript Challange - Simple background color flipper app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I took this challange to solidify my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.
Creating these small projects with plain JavaScript gave me a better understanding on how things work behind the scenes.

## Functionality

Two modes:

1.Simple - color is picked from an array that contains different color codes.
2.Hex - a random hex color code is generated every time.
